* Presentation 
Implementation of few machine learning models. we start with the decision trees model and we will see how this repo will evolve
* TODO: 
    * Rethink the module use ?
        * General machine learning algorithms?
        * Tree ML algo only?
    * Refactor and Improve readeability of the decision tree class
