* Presentation: Implementation of few machine learning models. we start with the decision trees model, svm, bagging
* TODO:
    * Rethink the module use ?
        * This repo has been changed to a **monorepo**
        * Tree ML algo only? --> **No, monorepo with all the algorithms**
    * Refactor and Improve readeability of the decision tree class: **In progress **
    * THe bagging supports only classification for now: **We need to add the regression part**
