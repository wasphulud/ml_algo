* Presentation: Implementation of the Support Vector Machine

Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a powerful and widely-used machine learning algorithm for classification and regression analysis. SVMs aim to find a hyperplane that best separates different classes in a high-dimensional feature space. In other words, SVMs seek to find the decision boundary that maximizes the margin between different classes.

The key idea behind SVMs is to transform the input data into a higher-dimensional feature space using a kernel function, which allows for better separation of different classes. SVMs then find the optimal hyperplane in this transformed feature space, which corresponds to the decision boundary in the original feature space. The optimal hyperplane is chosen to maximize the margin, which is the distance between the hyperplane and the closest points of each class.

SVMs have several advantages over other machine learning algorithms. For example, SVMs can handle non-linear decision boundaries and are less prone to overfitting than other algorithms. SVMs are also efficient for high-dimensional data and can handle large datasets.

There are several variations of SVMs, such as Support Vector Regression (SVR), which is used for regression analysis, and kernel SVMs, which use different kernel functions to transform the input data into a higher-dimensional feature space. SVMs have many applications, including image classification, text classification, bioinformatics, and finance.
