# Ensembling Methods

Ensembling methods in statistics refer to combining the predictions of multiple models to produce a more accurate and robust prediction.

## Bagging

Bagging methods involve training multiple models independently and combining their predictions by taking a simple average or majority vote.

Examples of bagging methods include:
- Random forests
- Bootstrap aggregating

Bagging methods are often used in classification and regression problems.

## Boosting

Boosting methods involve iteratively training models on the data, where each subsequent model tries to correct the errors of the previous one.

Examples of boosting methods include:
- AdaBoost
- Gradient boosting

Boosting methods are often used in classification and regression problems.

Ensembling methods have been shown to be highly effective in a wide range of applications, including:
- Image recognition
- Speech recognition
- Natural language processing
- Anomaly detection
- Recommendation systems

They are particularly useful when working with complex, high-dimensional data, where individual models may struggle to capture all the relevant information
