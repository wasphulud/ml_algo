## Decision Tree Implementation from Scratch
This repository contains a Python implementation of a decision tree algorithm from scratch, without using any external libraries.

## Overview
Decision trees are a popular machine learning algorithm that can be used for classification or regression tasks. The algorithm works by recursively splitting the dataset into subsets based on the value of a feature, and creating a tree-like model that represents the decision-making process.

This implementation includes the following features:

Ability to handle both categorical and numerical features
- Option to specify the maximum depth of the tree to prevent overfitting
- Option to specify the minimum number of samples required to split a node
